# midi-jitter-debug
A static HTML page for debugging MIDI jitter (preview [here](https://ianhalbwachs.github.io/midi-jitter-debug/); no internet connection is required once [downloaded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IanHalbwachs/midi-jitter-debug/master/index.html)).

Select the MIDI input to moniter, and send a steady stream of note on messages on channel 1 to view the distribution of durations between events.
